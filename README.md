# vim-khaled-ipsum 0.1.1
A lorem ipsum generator in the style of DJ Khaled. This vim plugin was 
inspired by the [Khaled Ipsum Generator](http://khaledipsum.com) written by my friend, Patrick 
Wong. I thought that the original generator found in the link above is hilarious and a fun alternative to the otherwise banal traditional generator. I knew that this needed to be made available to vim users and so here we are.

## Installation
I highly recommend you use the Vundle package manager. To install, simply add 
the following to your .vimrc
```
Plugin 'ftan84/vim-khaled-ipsum'
```

## Usage
To insert a DJ Khaled paragaraph, simply type the following command:
```
:Khalipsum
```
The command is also conveniently mapped to
```
<leader>kh
```
Simply type the above in normal mode to insert a paragraph's worth of DJ Khaled 
goodness.
